MapperGUI 2.0 - 2.1:
	Cynthia Higginbotham did much tweaking of MapperGUI and the
underlying mapper, and releases her derivative work under GNU Public
License 2.0 (see GPL20.txt). However, only the diffs between all
previous work and the current version are actually "my" work to so
license, until Mr. Marmont's rights and permissions are clarified.
