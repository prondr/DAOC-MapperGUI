MapperGUI v1.6
========================================================================

SUMMARY:
DAoC MapperGUI is a graphical user interface to 'Oliver Jowett's DAoC mapper.py',
a Dark Age of Camelot mapping program. The core mapper program written by Oliver
Jowett scans the game files installed on your drive and dynamically renders an image.

STARTING UP:
When the program is started for the first time the 'DAoC Game Path' will probably be
wrong for your PC. The 'DAoC Game Path' line should point directly at the folder you
have installed Dark Age of Camelot to. Once you have done this quit and restart
MapperGUI to create the 'Zone' menu.

THE MAIN WINDOW:
First select a zone from the 'Zone' menu, then tweak the 'Render options' to suit your
preference of map colours and transparencies(Alpha), and toggle on and off what you
wish to be drawn. You can then click the 'Render' button and it will start rendering.
Once this has  finished it will display the newly created image in the preview pane.
Once an image has been rendered it is available to be saved either by clicking the
'Save Image...' button or by selecting 'Save...' in the 'File' menu.

FILE MENU:
Save = Save a rendered image
Exit = Exit MapperGUI

ZONE MENU:
This is randomly generated depending what version of Dark Age of Camelot you have
installed. You select which zone to render from here.

OPTIONS MENU:
'OneClick' Captioning = Turn on one click captioning. Once this has been turned on you
can single click anywhere on a rendered map then the caption editor will appear with all
zone and coordinate information all ready entered, all you need to do is specifiy a caption
and then re-render.
Open Caption Editor = Opens the Caption Editor
Help = Your reading it!
About = General info

KNOWN ISSUES
Current MapperGUI does not render any Cities or Dungeons.  :(
